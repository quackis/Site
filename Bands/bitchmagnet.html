                            Bitch Magnet's first full album shows a wide variety of skill and sound. Songs like Motor and Navajo Ace show their mix of sludgy and noisy hard rock and early post-hardcore, while Clay and Big Pining show a balance between the buildup and breakdown of slow rhythms with more noisy riffs. Douglas Leader and Americruiser are two great displays of slow building post-rock-esque jams. Joan of Arc and Joyless Street are two straightforward, early post-hardcore inspired cuts. Punch and Judy is an emotional ride through angry vocals and a mix between angular and sludgy riffs.

                            The band's aggression is toned down a lot for this release, mainly using the vocals as a mere background, and focusing more on highlighting the noisy fuzz of their instrumental riffing. However this does not detract much from their consistency. Dragoon is a collage of all their great sounds from Umber, built into an almost 10-minute epic. Mesentary presents Bitch Magnet's noisiest vocals in a fast moving track. Valmead and Crescent are more examples of how Bitch Magnet managed to craft a great balance of slow and fast rhythms.
