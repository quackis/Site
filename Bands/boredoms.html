            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <p>Boredoms (ボアダムス (Boadamusu)) (later known as V∞redoms) is a rock band from Osaka, 
                Japan formed in 1986. The band's sound is often referred to as noise rock, or sometimes 
                Japanoise (Japan’s noise music scene), though their more recent records have mostly 
                featured repetitive minimalism, ambient music and tribal drumming.</p>

                            Boredoms' first full album is a wild and noisy barrage of sounds, at some points punk, others hard rock. 
                            It can be very reminiscent of The Stooges' noisiness, hence the title. This album is very much amateurish,
                            but showcases the potential of the group quite well.

                            Soul Discharge is a much more cohesive release, but nonetheless Boredoms still capitalizes on their now expected
                            wild noise. This was also their first album to feature Yoshimi P-We, whose psychotic vocals add an even more
                            abstract element to Boredoms' eccentricity. This would end up being Boredoms last mainly noise rock and punk based 
                            release, as they would move on to much more experimental and psychedelic works.

                            Boredoms' third full release shows the band at an early peak, showing off a great balance between their wild ramblings
                            and noisy boogies. Their composition skills have improved with lengthier songs like Bo-Go-Bompoo, Cheeba, and Cory & 
                            the Mandara Suicide Pyramid Action or Gas Satori. Molecicco and Telehorse Uma show a deranged mix of heavy rock with 
                            almost childish vocals. Many of the songs find a great balance between rock, punk, and noise.

                            Chocolate Synthesizer is a continuation of what Boredoms displayed on Pop Tatari. Acid Police is demented anthem
                            that gets fuzzier and louder. Shock City, Mama Brain, and Now Dom Go Synthesizer Way (Why?) 
                            are some of their more experimental works thus far, showing their sense 
                            for psychedelia. Many of the songs do not progress naturally, but instead jump between sounds and grooves very unpredictably.
                            The vocal work on Chocolate Synthesizer might be the most varied yet, which is saying a lot.

                            Super æ might be one of the greatest works of psychedelic music. Each of the seven tracks are unique masterpieces 
                            that tie together an album full of droning noise, blissful trances, abrasive instrumentals, tribal progressions, all 
                            together with Boredoms' supernatural vocals. Super You is a noisy piece that progresses and accelrates into piercing drones, 
                            eventually delving into a simple jam. Super Are starts with an almost orchestral sound with a transcendental vocal backing,
                            until it peaks and turns into a fast and heavy psych rhythm. Super Going starts with a repetitive and krautrock-esque instrumental
                            until reaching a psychedelic jam, to then return to its repetitive form. The end speeds up into a disorienting peak. 
                            Super Coming is another repetitive boogie, with a deranged vocal passage continuing throughout. The song reaches its' catharsis 
                            until delving into another slow psych groove. Super Are You presents the craziest vocals, an almost hypnotic and childish mix. The song 
                            then turns to a slow droning chant until it falls apart into a collage of synths. Super Shine starts with slow electronics until 
                            it reaches an alarm-like droning with a barrage of vocals, which then reaches another psychedelic frenzy. Super Good finishes the 
                            album with transcendental sounds ebbing and flowing, with bizarre noises pulsing throughout the song.
