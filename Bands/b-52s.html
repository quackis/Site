                            The B-52's debut album, which was very much responsible for the creation and introduction of a youthful, comedic, and eccentric take on rock music, produced a number of fascinating and unique songs. Utilizing abstract instruments (if we can even call them instruments) like walkie talkies, smoke alarms, toy pianos, as well as dual female vocals and regular male vocals, The B-52's crafted funky rhythms in the groovy Dance This Mess Around, and the extraterrestrial-like Planet Claire. 52 Girls is a surf-tinged rocking hit which masters the double female vocal. Rock Lobster is the iconic piece of the album, a funk and surf rock anthem. Lava and 6060-842 are two more quirky, genre-fused rockers.

                            The follow up album for The B-52's captured much of the same synergy but sacrificed the absurdity for a more pop oriented effort. The group still managed to create some infectious tracks that highlight the dual female vocals more than ever. Their best efforts on this album come from Private Idaho and Give Me Back My Man. Strobe Light is a dancy jam, Party out of Bounds and Devil in My Car are two solid, almost hard rock tracks, and 53 Miles West of Venus is psychedelic chant to end the album.

                            Whammy! is The B-52's third album, and given the three year period between this and Wild Planet, it fails to show much of any progression. Legal Tender is an uplifting tune, but Whammy Kiss drags on too long, and somewhat lacks their enthusiasm. Song for a Future Generation is a goofy track, and turns out to be the highlight of Whammy!, but the album loses steam after that, only to really be picked up by a few songs on the second half.

                            Bouncing Off the Satellites doesn't have much to show. Out of their first four it is their poppiest release. However too many of the songs lack any drive or enthusiasm, it's a very go through the motions type of sound. Summer of Love and Girl From Ipanema Goes to Greenland work decently as pop rock jams. Juicy Jungle is the one funky boogie that seems to work in their favor. Ain't It a Shame and She Brakes for Rainbows are two sad ballad-like pieces.

                            Right when it looked like The B-52's had headed to the point of no return, they came back with Cosmic Thing, showing a revitalized and synergized group. Most of the songs here are in the realm of pop rock, but it works in their favor. The pop hit Love Shack might be their catchiest song to date, maybe even more than Rock Lobster, and the anthemic Roam is another contender as well. Other highlights of the album include the funky Cosmic Thing, the groovy Dry County, and the energy building Junebug. Other tracks include Deadbeat Club, the sweet ballad, Channel Z and Topaz two synth filled cuts, and the almost dark finisher Follow Your Bliss.

                            After the sound revival that Cosmic Thing consisted of, it'd be hard to imagine The B-52's going in a bad direction. Love Shack and Roam showed great energy and fun, and the rest of the album created a pop sound that could have kept them popular through the 90's. Unfortunately Good Stuff did not live up to the standard that Cosmic Thing set. The beginning trio of songs, sitting at 15 minutes, sounds much too copied and uninterested. The same goes for the almost 8-minute Dreamland, or the unusual Is That You Mo-Dean? The only justifiable songs are the graceful Revolution Earth and the melodic Vision of a Kiss. It doesn't help that every song but the instrumental has a 5+ minute runtime.
