            <p>The Jesus Lizard is an American rock band formed in 1987 in Austin, 
                Texas and based in Chicago, Illinois. They were "a leading noise rock
                band in the American independent undergroundâ€¦[who] turned out a series
                of independent records filled with scathing, disembowelling,
                guitar-driven pseudo-industrial noise</p>

                            The Jesus Lizard's second release is their masterpiece. Noisier and more grating guitar riffs,
                            pounding drums and dizzying cymbals, and prophetic chanting vocals. From start to finish 
                            Goat is an endless barrage of psychotic ramblings and noisy instrumentals, with almost no breathing room in between.

                            A logical continuation of the sounds and synergy portrayed on Goat. At some points crazier,
                            at some louder, but much of what is seen on Goat is brought over to Liar. Some of the highlights
                            of Liar might be greater to some than that of Goat.

                            The Jesus Lizard's most polished release yet, which is saying a lot considering their records before.
                            Nonetheless, it's all the greatness they've already perfected from Goat and Liar now more 
                            refined. While not much new is brough to the table, they see no need to change from their insanity.

                            By this time much of their sound has been exhausted, however they still prove to
                            be consistent and confident. Shot is still the same Jesus Lizard, however this is the first of their
                            album's to lack Steve Albini's production, which does bring a new element to David Yow's yelling.

                            The Jesus Lizard walk the line between their own deranged noise rock and a much more tame alternative rock
                            on Blue. However, that isn't to say they've lost their charm. At some points it works and others it doesn't,
                            leaving The Jesus Lizard's last album to be a good point to end, sooner than later.
