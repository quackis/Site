                            Black Eyes' debut album was one of, if not the best punk/hardcore album from the 2000's on. Embodying energy and charisma like no other band, Black Eyes' self titled album displays chaotic and passionate vocals in combination with hysteric and unforgettable instrumentals. The band utilized two drummers, two bassists, one guitarist, and multiple vocalists. Someone Has His Fingers Broken leads off the album with a funky bass, an uncontrollable guitar, and frantically chanted vocals. A Pack of Wolves continues the passion with screamed dual vocals over a groovy but wild instrumental. Yes, I Confess is a hypnotic and abrasive anthem. On the Sacred Side and Nine go hand in hand, starting with a tribal-like boogie, leading into a noisy, hectic guitar until peaking and devolving into an untamed instrumental. Speaking in Tongues contains overlapping yelled vocals over an addicting bassline, until they reach a shouted climax. Deformative, the highlight of the album and one of the masterpieces of the 2000's is a fast, manic jam filled with absurd guitar riffs, dizzying drumming, and deranged vocals. King's Dominion and Letter to Raoul Peck are two funky rhythms with passionate and unchained vocals. Day Turns Night is the most unrestricted song, working through guitar feedback and an eerie groove.

                            Their second full album came two months after the band split, and presented a slight change of direction from their debut album. Cough starts with Cough, Cough, which feels like an almost improvised instrumental leading into soft spoken lyrics. Eternal Life starts with the same idea of an improvised sound, until reaching a frenzied boogie, adding jazz instruments to the mix. False Positive continues the boogie with a dual vocal barrage. Drums is a slow moving anthem driven by a funky bassline and repetitive drums. Scrapes and Scratches and Fathers of Daughters are two frenzied pieces, with deranged vocals and unpredictable instrumentals. Holy of Holies is another anthemic song leading to a barrage of awkward vocals over a blaring saxophone. Commencement has no limits, and is almost impossible to follow. Spring Into Winter and Another Country are fast and rhythmic, both utilizing the jazz instruments to help their dizzying punk sound. A Meditation closes the album with a unsteady chant before falling into a noisy end.
