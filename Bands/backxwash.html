                            Backxwash's debut album sits at just over 20 minutes in length, fusing industrial, rock, hip-hop and horrorcore. Don't Come to the Woods and Devil in a Mosh Pit are two abrasive and industrial raps. Bad Juju is an aggressive, head banging rap. Deviancy shows intense vocals over a grating instrumental. You Like My Body the Way It Is is a soft keyboard driven piece, with an emotional rap to join it. Burn Me at the Stake finishes the album with a desperate chant over a guitar riff.

                            Continuing the energy of Deviancy's most aggressive cuts, Backxwash's second album focuses on the dense and industrial atmosphere. Many of the tracks, such as Black Magic and Into the Void, are passionate, yelled raps as if an outlet for aggression. This release shows a growth for Backxwash, with unique and intuitive instrumentals, intense and personal lyrical themes, and stronger compositional skills.

                            Emotional, powerful, and just as abrasive as Backxwash's previous release, I Lie Here Buried With My Rings and My Dresses is in a sense a continuation of her passion. The title track shows her at her most experimental, and it works in her favor, possibly being her best yet. Wail of the Banshee and In Thy Holy Name sound a lot like a standard for her, loud industrial beats and angry vocals. Song of Sinners' raps over a Nine Inch Nails-like instrumental, with a poppy chorus. Burn to Ashes is a a dark and apocalyptic end to the album.
