                            After releasing three singles, including the passionate and aggressive Sunglasses, Black Country, New Road debuted with For the First Time. The album contained the three singles and two new tracks, however they reworked the impressive Sunglasses to a more mellow and subdued version. The intro Instrumental contains horns, tribal drumming, and a repetitive keyboard rhythm. Athens, France is their tribute to Slint, containing very similar guitar and drumming patterns. Science Fair is another Slint-like narrative piece, containing awkward vocals, leading to a noisy and theatric ending. Track X is a slow buildup, starting almost hollow, but doesn't lead to much. Opus closes the album with a speedy and intricate instrumental, in contrast with slow and hushed vocals.

                            Black Country, New Road changed their pace and style for their second release, embracing an Arcade Fire-like sound. Chaos Space Marine starts the album off with that sound. Concorde continues that along with a four-minute slow buildup. Good Will Hunting leads slowly into an emotional climax. The Place Where He Inserted the Blade is a melodic piece, balancing between slow, instrumental passages and climactic releases. Snow Globes takes a while to buildup, but peaks with speedy drumming and frantically yelled vocals before returning to its slow orchestral state. Basketball Shoes meanders too long without enough interest to reach it's peak. Many of the longer tracks on the album suffer from this problem.
