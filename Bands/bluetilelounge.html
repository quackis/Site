                            Bluetile Lounge's debut album was released amongst the few pivotal slowcore groups of the 90's, including Codeine, Red House Painters, and Low. Bluetile Lounge found a union of melancholic instumentals and sleepylike vocals, displayed through five extended tracks. Ambered is the highlight of Lowercase, turning a drowsy lullabyesque piece into a gorgeous synthesis of melodies. Wriding is the densest and most atmospheric track, while Gm and Figure Ground work as lush instrumentals that carry the soft vocals along with it. The Weight (and the Sea) builds another drifting song into a collective fusion before ending.

                            The second and final album before Bluetile Lounge's split, Half-Cut, improves and elevates the sounds they displayed on their debut album. Liner is a fuzzy, shoegazey intro that transitions back and forth between a quiet and loud slowcore melody. Steeped and Lapsis are two peaceful songs, slowly leading to calming climaxes. Ltd reintroduces the fuzzy guitars of Liner, in combination with some of their most emotional vocals of the album. Old Star might be the masterpiece of Half-Cut, leading a four minute sleepy intro into a powerful and dense rhythm, to once again fade and then reanimate into a powerful ending.
