            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <p>Bauhaus is an English rock band, formed in Northampton, England, in 1978. 
                The group consists of Daniel Ash (guitar, saxophone), Peter Murphy 
                (vocals, occasional instruments), Kevin Haskins (drums) and David J (bass). 
                One of the pioneers of gothic rock, Bauhaus were known for their dark image 
                and gloomy sound, although they mixed many genres, including dub, glam rock, 
                psychedelia, and funk.</p>

                            Following the two singles Bela Lugosi's Dead and Dark Entries, which the former might be their masterpiece and the latter 
                            an addictive post-punk anthem, Bauhaus released their debut album. While it may have not lived up to the two singles they 
                            prefaced the album with, they still managed to create a consistent and impressive first album. The lead combination of 
                            Double Dare and In the Flat Field is hypnotizing. Songs like A God in an Alcove and The Spy in the Cab set the stage for 
                            much of the 80's gothic sound. The finale of Nerves is a fantastic end to the album.

                            Bauhaus's second full album, released a year after In the Flat Field, represents a great progression for their sound. Instead 
                            of repeating the gothic essence of their first album, the addition of keyboards, acoustic guitar, and the saxophone add more 
                            layers to their dark style. It seemed to also let them experiment more, working much in their favor. Hair of the Dog might be 
                            their most punk song on the album, where The Passion of Lovers is a hard rocking chant. Of Lillies and Remains and Muscle in Plastic 
                            are dub-tinged bass driven tracks. Dancing and The Man with X-Ray Eyes are two great gothic additions. Kick in the Eye is a dance-punk 
                            jig, and shows Bauhaus at their catchiest. Mask is a dark and eerie conclusion to the album, ending with a loud and angular guitar rhythm.

                            The Sky's Gone Out starts with a cover of Brian Eno's incredible Third Uncle, and while the cover isn't bad, it's not the strongest 
                            start to the album. Silent Hedges and In the Night are redeeming follow up songs, however the six minute Swing the Heartache doesn't 
                            lead anywhere. Spirit leads a peaceful buildup into a frenzied chant. The three parts of The Three Shadows meander without much of interest. 
                            All We Ever Wanted Was Everything is a sad ballad. Exquisite Corpse is an almost awkward piece, 
                            that builds to an aggressive freakout, to then delve into the sound of someone sleeping, to once again retreat into it's aggression.

                            Much of the making of this album took place during internal difficulties with the band members, which on listen is almost hard not to hear. The continuity and focus of the group seemed to have been at an all time low. Still, Bauhaus was able to craft some notable tracks including the manic Antonin Artaud, and the slow and gorgeous Who Killed Mr. Moonlight. There's also Bauhaus's longest song since Bela Lugosi's Dead, Burning From the Inside which is a minimal post-punk experiment, toying with echoing vocals and an endless bass groove. Hope ends the album on an oddly light note.

                            Bauhaus's fifth album, coming 25 years after their previous effort, fails to revive the remaining energy they had in the 80's. The tracks seem to work too hard to recreate old sounds, none of which sticks. Endless Summer Of The Damned might be the only song to sound natural in it's endeavor, and could easily fit in with some of their early albums. Mirror Remains is an attempt to rehash their slow and eerie tracks such as Haunting Hills or Mask. The Dog's A Vapour is another creepy, slow burning track that ends in a psychotic and industrial soundscape.
