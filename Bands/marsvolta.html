            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <p>The Mars Volta was an American progressive rock band from El Paso, Texas, formed in 2001. 
                The band formed following the break-up of Rodríguez-López
                 and Bixler-Zavala's previous band, At the Drive-In. 
                 They are known for their energetic live shows and their concept albums.</p>

                            The Mars Volta's first full album represents the transitional phase of the band.
                            While still displaying some of the strenghts of At the Drive-In, they
                            border the lines between progressive rock and post-hardcore. De-Loused shows the
                            group experimenting with more bizarre vocals, transitions, instrumental passages, and long 
                            song lengths.

                            Frances the Mute not only improves upon the elements of De-Loused, it presents a 
                            multi-layered story that delves into a variety of genres. Each song is a masterful
                            piece, and in cohesion they work even better together. From the magnificent build up and jam of
                            Cygnus...Vismund Cygnus to the haunting and beautiful The Widow. From the psychedelic and latin covered L'Via L'Viaquez
                            to the eery and disturbing Miranda That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore. To finally reach the climax at
                            the 32 minute epic Cassandra Gemini, which highlights all of what has been shown on the album thus far. 
                            This album is a tour de force on all levels, and is truly one of great works of progressive rock.

                            Amputechture changes the pace once again as their third full album. Spanning the 
                            same variety that benefit Frances the Mute, The Mars Volta take that further. 
                            Vicarious Atonement is a slow build up of guitar shredding and ethereal vocals.
                            Tetragrammaton is a 17 minute epic of a multitude of transitions, with two great peaks.
                            Meccamputechture and Viscera Eyes are two more multi-transitional jams, each succeeding
                            in their own rights. Day of the Baphomets might be the masterpiece of the album, with each
                            section building to the next and climaxing in a frenzied chant. Asilos Magdalena and El
                            Ciervo Vulnerado are two latin influenced psychedelic grooves.

                            The Bedlam in Goliath continues The Mars Volta's signature progressive sound. In some
                            forms this is their most hectic album yet, with songs like Metatron and Goliath never 
                            seeming to flow fluidly. However, while this album does master the chaotic boogies we 
                            know so well, it does not reach the highs of the previous two albums, nor does it present
                            the same cohesion. Nonetheless, this album is still the classic The Mars Volta.

                            The Mars Volta slow down a lot on this record, and for the most part it does not compliment
                            their sound. This is also their shortest full length album yet, which says a lot considering
                            the massive amount of sound they've put into their previous efforts. They still manage to 
                            add some interesting and unique songs to their discography.

                            Their last full length album before their split, The Mars Volta still show much of the same.
                            Most of the album presents a tamer and poppier sound, however it seems to work in their favor
                            for a good amount of tracks. Still though, it lacks the consistency and flow of their previous works.
