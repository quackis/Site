            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <p>Bark Psychosis are an English post-rock band/musical project from east London 
                formed in 1986. They were one of the bands that Simon Reynolds cited when 
                coining "post-rock" as a musical style in 1994, and are thus considered one 
                of the key bands defining the genre.</p>

                            The debut album from Bark Psychosis was one of the pioneering works of the 90's post-rock uprising. Utilizing 
                            a wide variety of instruments, in sync with soft and calming songs developed a blissful combination. The seven 
                            tracks of Hex emphasize the calming nature of music, never pushing into over the top rhythms and sounds, but instead slowly 
                            building and flowing through each piece, almost aimlessly.

                            Independency is a compilation of Bark Psychosis's pre-Hex EPs and singles. Each song is powerful in it's 
                            own way, and none of them settle to be too standard or similar. Although the release lacks the same pacing as Hex 
                            would master, it is still undoubtedly a solid release with very few weak points. The two EPs, All Different Things and 
                            Manman are the most consistent, and Scum may be one of the greatest works of the 90s.

                            Where Hex succeeds in the soft and bare, minimilast approach to rock, Bark Psychosis's second album after a 
                            decade shows the group turning to a more ethereal and hypnotic approach. Graham Sutton's skill in developing mesmerizing 
                            instrumentals proves that even a change in style doesn't prevent him from exceeding in what he already did 
                            so well. ///Codename: Dustsucker is an impressive release considering the decade between albums.
