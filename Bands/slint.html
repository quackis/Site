                            Tweez, produced by Steve Albini, showcases a band that's already comfortable 
                            with their sound. Ron and Carol are both heavy and abrasive boogies, revealing both spoken word 
                            and piercing shrieks. Nan Ding is an eerie spoken word over a repetitive guitar riff.
                            Kent is lonely and meandering trip. Charlotte and Warren 
                            reveal more of the faster and industrial sounds they're capable of. Darlene is a 
                            spoken word whisper. Pat is a fast and rhythmic tune which struggles to stand still. 
                            Rhoda close the album with a piercing guitar instrumental.

                            Spiderland is an ultimate masterpiece of rock music. The six tracks of Spiderland 
                            all deconstruct and revolutionize many of the sounds of rock before them. Breadcrumb 
                            Trail is a spoken word track that guides the listener through a story of a fortune teller 
                            at a carnival. The track leads up to multiple climaxes of screams with fuzzy and noisy 
                            instrumentals to back it up. Nosferatu Man presents the story of Nosferatu behind a slow 
                            and repetitive rhythm. Don, Aman tells the dark story of a suicidal man at a party, with 
                            the story enhanced through the spoken word style. The song reaches a peak of noise 
                            near the end until it delves into a slow outro. Washer is a slow and psychedelic song, 
                            reaching another noisy peak with loud jarring guitars, until it once again falls into 
                            a slow outro. For Dinner... is an almost peaceful instrumental, playing with slow paces 
                            and silent passages. Good Morning Captain, which is most likely their greatest song, 
                            tells the story of a captain at sea using the same spoken word process. The instrumental 
                            guides the voice of the narrator through multiple highs and lows, until the song and album 
                            reaches its' catharsis, with the captain screaming at the top of his lungs to close out the album.
